Around the world, countries are trying to reduce their CO2 emissions so that we, future generations and our planet can continue to live and exist without a terrible climate catastrophe. We must make efforts to make our lifestyles, our industries and our society sustainable. This starts with ourselves, our communities, our cantons and our country, Switzerland.

This website is serves to display the progress of Switzerland, its cantons and communes in 3 key sustainability metrics:
     
* Solar potential usage: share of roof area that is economically and technologically exploitable that already has solar pannels installed.
* Renewable heating share: share of building with renewable heat technologies
* Electric car share: percentage of electric cars vs combustion cars.
     

So come take a look and see how your region is doing! Can your region do better? Is your region already a pioneer in sustainable development and an example for the rest of Switzerland?

Maybe you can contibute to the community yourself by switching to an electric car?
